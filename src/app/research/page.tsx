    fullContent: `CARBON TAX THROUGH THE ECONOMIC LENS

Carbon tax is a tax levied on the basis of the equivalent carbon emissions emitted during the production of a unit of goods and relevant services such as processing, transportation or logistics. The carbon tax constitution underwent three distinct stages of development: 
Initial Exploration Stage (1990–2004)
Rapid Development Stage (2005–2018)
Deepening and Expansion Stage (2019–Present): By 2023, 30 countries, including Singapore and South Africa, implemented 38 carbon tax policies across Europe, the Americas, Asia, Africa, and Oceania.
By 2023, carbon taxes were widely implemented across Europe, leading to cumulative emissions reductions of 4–6% with a $40/ton CO2 tax covering 30% of emissions. This occurred without adverse effects on GDP growth or employment among the 31 EU-ETS countries. However, weaknesses remain, such as continued legal pollution by enterprises willing to pay the tax (*) and the competitive advantage for countries without carbon taxes (**). Meanwhile, renewables accounted for over 30% of global electricity production in 2023, offering a favorable alternative for carbon reduction, according to the Global Electricity Review.
Therefore, this essay will go into detail three bullet points:
The unique negative and positive effects anticipated from carbon taxes compared to subsidies for renewable energy.
How valid are the criticisms (*) and (**) and what are the additional issues of carbon tax that need tackling by alternatives. 
Potential alternatives to solve the concerns raised in (2).


a) The unique positive effects of carbon taxes: 

First: A carbon tax immediately raises the cost of high-emission activities, driving rapid emissions reductions without requiring investments in renewable energy infrastructure or transmission lines. Unlike renewable infrastructure, which relies on polluting components, a carbon tax leverages existing systems while making polluting energy sources less economical.
In 2022, U.S. construction costs for solar photovoltaic systems and wind turbines remained similar to 2021 levels, with slight increases of 1.7% for solar and 1.6% for wind, while costs for natural gas-fired electricity generators dropped by 11%. Despite minor cost changes, renewable energy infrastructure still requires significant investment and time for full implementation. In contrast, a carbon tax can deliver immediate results once implemented.
Second: Contrary to the case of subsidised renewable energy in the first section mentioned above, carbon tax can generate revenue for governments and other national purposes. Revenues from carbon taxes can be used to fund other environmental initiatives, support businesses in transitioning to cleaner technologies, or improve environmental policies. 
Carbon tax revenues, along with those from emissions trading systems (ETS), have surged significantly over time. Notably, carbon tax revenue has grown substantially, accounting for a considerable portion of the total. This trend highlights the potential of carbon tax policies to contribute to economic reform and sustainability.
Third: Carbon taxes could impact many sectors beyond renewable energy. For example, industries such as cement, steel, and transportation would also have to find ways to reduce emissions if they were taxed. Renewable energy, on the other hand, primarily addresses emissions in the electricity sector. In particular, carbon taxes can be applied to highly carbon-intensive industries that do not necessarily rely on renewable energy or cannot easily transition to renewables. This includes:
- Heavy Industry: Steel production, cement manufacturing, and chemical industries emit large amounts of CO₂, even though they might not directly use renewable energy sources.
- Agriculture: Farming can emit greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide, which are not easily addressed by renewable energy subsidies. Carbon taxes on these emissions incentivize the adoption of low-emission farming practices.
- Waste Management: Landfills and waste incineration are significant sources of methane and CO₂, but these sectors are not typically impacted by renewable energy subsidies.
b) The unique negative effects of carbon taxes: 

First: A carbon tax on fossil fuels is often regressive in its impact-hurting poorer people relatively more than richer ones. Even when it might be progressive, poorer people still suffer a welfare loss when prices rise, making their consumption basket more expensive. 

The figure highlights the significant impact of a carbon tax on low-income households, despite being a smaller portion of the tax burden. These households often face higher energy costs relative to income due to less efficient housing and transportation. As a result, a carbon tax disproportionately affects them by increasing energy expenses.
Second: Carbon Leakage
Together with implementing the carbon tax policy, we should consider that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in one country or region lead to an increase in emissions in another country or region. 
The leakage rates reflect constant marginal effects, but in practice they may be non-linear because large price increases may trigger different responses compared to small price changes, and because no carbon spillovers can arise in sectors that have zero emission.
Third: In case the tax rate is set too low or is introduced gradually, it can be easily anticipated to not be sufficient to change behavior or accelerate the transition to renewable energy. 
a) The criticism (*) can be directly linked to the third unique negative effect of carbon tax. This can be the case in reality but there are possibilities that shouldn’t be neglected: 
The carbon tax makes companies that rely heavily on carbon-intensive energy face higher operational costs (labour cost, other federal taxes,...) so that they are not likely to splash out on carbon tax easily just to emit CO2 as they want. In other words, companies have to consider various costs and sectors (economic instability) other than carbon tax. 
Another possible case is that under pressure of carbon tax, companies will move to countries that have no carbon tax (carbon leakage).
The criticism (**) poses the question concerning the problem that carbon tax will deal a blow to the economic health of the countries implementing this policy. This can be the case as long as the economic state of all countries all over the world are equal and the product price is the same. However, the countries that implement carbon tax (EU countries) are generally more economically developed compared to the countries that don’t utilize carbon tax (most of which are developing countries). 
=> The economic states of countries that use carbon tax are not likely to be destabilized or affected easily (though possibly marginally).

   (2) b) Other issues of carbon tax:
Carbon tax does not directly target other carbon compounds, such as methane, which has a short atmospheric lifetime but a large warming potential. Carbon emissions from agriculture/livestock, deforestation, waste management, or poor land use, are hard to assess and monitor and these are generally not taxed directly.
Cost uncertainty creates opposition, and exemptions degrade efficacy. Calibration requires balancing numerous stakeholders and objectives. Therefore, we need a scrupulously and sophisticatedly designed policy regarding carbon tax.
Some critics argue funds could be better utilised directly in green infrastructure as opposed to tax hoping for certain emission cuts because precise emissions reductions from any given tax level involves estimating complex, interconnected behavioural changes across millions of energy consumers.

Alternatives to solve the problems: 

Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms (CBAM):
Imposing a tariff or fee on imported goods based on their carbon content will: 
Ensure that products from countries without carbon taxes face the same environmental cost as domestic products.
Prevent carbon leakage 
Ensures fair commercial competition for every country.

Cap-and-Trade (Emissions Trading Systems - ETS)
Setting a limit on total emissions, authorizing a set number of carbon credits in which case companies emit less than their cap can sell surplus credits to others that exceed their emissions limits will: 
Enable businesses to have flexibility in how they meet emission reduction targets, either by reducing emissions or purchasing credits from others.
Ensures that overall emissions decrease over time.
Governments can auction carbon credits to raise funds for green investments.

Voluntary Carbon Markets
Giving companies, non-profit organizations, governments, and individuals the opportunity to buy and sell carbon offset credits will: 
Provides a flexible way to support emissions reduction efforts and allows entities to participate in global climate action without waiting for government mandates.
Example: The VMC Verra has issued over 1.1 billion verified carbon credits consisting of over 2,000 project activities around the world and has been used in over 88 countries.
All things considered, to move towards the future and solve environmental problems together with economic development, correct and reasonable policies and laws should be implemented properly.

    description: "An analysis of Trump-era tariffs and their lasting economic impact on U.S. businesses, households, and global trade relations.

    fullContent: `When Donald Trump first slapped tariffs on foreign goods, the move was sold as a bold play to “bring jobs back” and protect American industries. Years later, the economic aftershocks are still shaking businesses, households, and even the country’s global standing. Just this week, a U.S. appeals court declared that many of those tariffs were illegal, saying the president didn’t have the authority to impose such broad duties without Congress. For now, the ruling is on hold until mid-October, giving Trump’s legal team time to fight back, likely all the way to the Supreme Court. If these tariffs fall, it could trigger a messy reset in trade policy.
    

But even if the legal battle drags on, the economic reality is already clear: tariffs act like taxes. According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, the tariffs introduced in April 2025 could shave 6% off long-term GDP and cut wages by about 5%. That’s a $22,000 lifetime loss for the average middle-income household. Yes, tariffs might bring in $5 trillion over a decade, but they also make imports more expensive and slow the economy down. A recent survey of top economists found nearly 9 in 10 believe tariffs will hurt growth and push inflation higher.


On the ground, businesses are feeling the squeeze. U.S. retailers are warning of higher prices on everything from furniture to electronics. The removal of the $800 duty-free threshold for small parcels means extra fees for online shoppers and extra headaches for small businesses. Even global supply chains are taking hits. In South Korea, the petrochemical industry is shrinking after U.S. duties on imports - once set at 25% - forced some plants to shut down.

The fallout isn’t just economic - it’s diplomatic. India, one of America’s key partners, now faces tariffs on up to 70% of its exports to the U.S. That includes shrimp, a major product, which analysts say could drop by nearly 18%. As U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan recently put it, these policies are making America look “unreliable” to its allies, while giving China room to strengthen ties in Asia.


So, what’s the big picture? Tariffs were supposed to make America stronger. Instead, they’ve raised prices for consumers, strained global alliances, and sparked tit-for-tat retaliation from trading partners. Economists say the math hasn’t changed: tariffs almost always reduce overall welfare. They’re a tax by another name—one that businesses and households ultimately pay. Whether Trump’s tariffs survive in court or not, their economic and political legacy is likely to linger for years.`
